# Kudlit

Kudlit is a vision-based Baybayin translator and learning app built in Flutter. This repository now treats the bundled [`Kudlit Design System`](<Kudlit Design System/README.md>) as the visual source of truth and mirrors it through a Flutter theme, shared assets, and branded placeholder screens.

## Current Setup

- App shell and auth flow use a shared Flutter design-system layer under `lib/core/design_system/`.
- The bundled Baybayin display font and reference assets are copied into `assets/fonts/` and `assets/brand/` for normal Flutter usage.
- The current home screen is a branded placeholder derived from the mobile UI kit while feature work for scanner, translator, and lessons continues.
- The original design-system source remains in [`Kudlit Design System/`](<Kudlit Design System/>) for previews, reference JSX, and asset provenance.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Flutter (Dart) |
| State management | Riverpod (`riverpod_annotation`) |
| Routing | `go_router` |
| Backend auth | Supabase |
| Character detection | YOLO → TFLite (`ultralytics_yolo`) |
| Language understanding | Gemma 4 |
| Error handling | `Either<Failure, T>` via `fpdart` |

## Getting Started

```bash
flutter doctor
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

Useful commands:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build web
dart format lib/ test/
```

## Architecture

The app follows feature-first clean architecture:

- `presentation -> domain <- data`
- `domain` stays pure Dart
- repositories are defined in `domain` and implemented in `data`
- app-wide visual decisions live in `core/design_system/`, not inside feature widgets

Current feature intent:

- `auth`: implemented and now wrapped in the branded Kudlit auth shell
- `scanner`: planned camera and image-upload recognition flow
- `translator`: planned Baybayin transliteration and Gemma-assisted interpretation
- `learn`: planned lessons, quizzes, and reference content

## Design System Notes

- Token source: [`Kudlit Design System/colors_and_type.css`](<Kudlit Design System/colors_and_type.css>)
- Brand guidance: [`Kudlit Design System/README.md`](<Kudlit Design System/README.md>)
- Local repo workflow notes: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md)
- Gemini CLI entrypoint: [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md)
- Repo-local Gemini frontend skill: [skills/flutter-frontend/SKILL.md](skills/flutter-frontend/SKILL.md)

Important limitation:

- The design docs specify Geist for the UI font, but this repository currently only bundles the Baybayin display font. The shared Flutter theme already applies the Kudlit color, radius, and spacing language, and Baybayin headings use the bundled font directly.

## Gemini CLI Setup

Install `obra/superpowers` in Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
```

This repository also includes a local Gemini extension:

- [gemini-extension.json](gemini-extension.json)
- [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md)
- [skills/flutter-frontend/SKILL.md](skills/flutter-frontend/SKILL.md)

Recommended usage:

- Use `obra/superpowers` for process skills such as brainstorming, planning, debugging, TDD, and review
- Use the local `flutter-frontend` skill for Kudlit-specific Flutter UI and design-system implementation

## Working Rules

- Keep UI mobile-first even when using Chrome as the design target.
- Do not bypass `core/design_system/` for shared colors, type, surfaces, or brand assets.
- Keep widgets focused on display; move business logic into Riverpod notifiers and use cases.
- Prefer relative imports within a feature and `package:kudlit_ph/...` across features.
- Use single quotes and explicit types.
